	<p>
		Rewyr centers on <strong>Rewire Agents</strong> â€” modular agents that analyze and improve how LLMs are used in your application. 
		Each agent focuses on a specific area such as prompt design, context management, best practices or model choice.
	</p>

	<h2>What We Solve</h2>
	<p>
		LLM logic is often scattered across a codebase with inconsistent prompts, unclear parameters, and hard-to-track behavior. 
		This makes it difficult to improve performance, ensure consistency, or scale reliably.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rewyr lets you apply multiple optimization agents across your LLM workflows in one pass. 
		It turns slow, manual tuning into fast, structured feedback you can act on immediately.
	</p>


	<h2>How Rewyr Helps</h2>
	<p>
		Rewyr surfaces inefficiencies and blind spots in your LLM usage and suggests improvements through focused, actionable agents. 
		It brings structure and clarity to an otherwise opaque layer of system design.
