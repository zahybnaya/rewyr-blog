	<p>
		Rewyr is a powerful CLI tool designed to revolutionize how developers work with LLM-integrated applications. 
		Born from the recognition that while it's easy to get started with LLM-based solutions, optimizing them 
		for production use remains challenging, Rewyr bridges this gap by providing intelligent analysis and 
		optimization capabilities.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		Our mission is to make LLM integration not just accessible, but truly optimized. We believe that every 
		LLM interaction in your codebase should be as efficient, cost-effective, and reliable as possible. 
		Rewyr transforms the way you think about LLM usage by treating each interaction as an "atom" that can 
		be analyzed, understood, and improved.
	</p>

	<h2>The Technology</h2>
	<p>
		Rewyr operates on an atom-level approach, where each LLM interaction is treated as an individual unit 
		that can be analyzed, optimized, and managed independently. Our system uses sophisticated detection 
		algorithms to identify LLM usage patterns, extract templates, and understand the context of each interaction.
	</p>

	<p>
		The heart of Rewyr lies in its RewireAgents - specialized improvement agents that focus on specific 
		aspects of LLM optimization such as prompt enhancement, temperature adjustment, model selection, 
		and context management. These agents work together to provide comprehensive optimization recommendations.
	</p>

	<h2>What We Solve</h2>
	<p>
		Modern applications often contain dozens or hundreds of LLM interactions scattered throughout their 
		codebase. Without proper tooling, it's nearly impossible to understand the full picture of your 
		LLM usage, identify optimization opportunities, or maintain consistency across interactions. 
		Rewyr solves this by providing:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Complete visibility into your LLM usage patterns</li>
		<li>Automated detection and cataloging of LLM interactions</li>
		<li>Intelligent optimization suggestions based on best practices</li>
		<li>Cost and performance analysis tools</li>
		<li>Data management for fine-tuning and improvement</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Why Choose Rewyr?</h2>
	<p>
		Unlike static analysis tools that simply find patterns, Rewyr goes deeper by understanding the 
		intent and context of your LLM interactions. Our approach is comprehensive, covering everything 
		from initial detection through optimization implementation. We're not just about finding problems - 
		we're about solving them intelligently.
	</p>

	<p>
		Join us in revolutionizing LLM integration. Whether you're a startup experimenting with AI or an 
		enterprise scaling LLM-powered features, Rewyr provides the tools you need to optimize your 
		AI workflows and achieve better results with lower costs.
